# R4newbies
Date I start this project: March 19, 2018

This is to document my journey to learning R and RStudio as a total newbie.

The first thing I had to do was figure out how to get RStudio to interact with GitHub.
This link contained all the information I needed to accomplish this first task.

Yesterday I posted my initial question about how to get started using R from an absolute beginners perspective, because I know next to nothing about R and RStudio.

The responses have been astoundingly wonderful, and I will attempt to use this site to log my learning curve of R and RStudio.

#First questions
## What is R
* As of now, my best answer is that R is a (very robust) programming language capable of a great many things. To me, the R language seems primarily focused on gathering, manipulating, analyzing, and presenting data in all its various forms.
