## R Markdown setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

To begin, one has to have an idea of what packages R will need to load to accomplish your goals. The packages below are the ones I will need to analyze the pilot data.

These are ASQ pilot analyses are for the alcohol grant.

```{r}
library(readxl) # This is used to import data from excel
library(tidyverse)
library(ez)
#library(Hmisc)
#library(reshape2)

library(here)
here() # THIS SETS THE WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE LOCATION OF THIS FILE
dr_here(show_reason = TRUE)

```

## SET THE WORKING DIRECTORY
```{r}
# where files are:
# setwd("/Users/meredithjohnson/Box Sync/My Stuff/MyStuffForPainLab/Questionnaire Pilot Data")
#setwd("/Users/jcraggs/Box Sync/Grants/Alcohol_Pain/PsychoPy_ASQ-Questionniares_Pilot_Data/")
setwd("/Users/jcraggs/Box Sync/Grants/Alcohol_Pain/ASQ_pilot/")

```

## IMPORT DATA FOR THE PILOT ANALYSES
```{r}
#Read Data
# Data exported from RedCap on April 4, 2019
#data=read.csv('ImagingPsychometrics_DATA_2019-04-04_1240.csv')
#data2=read.csv('ImagingPsychometrics_DATA_2019-04-04_1240.csv')
data_ORIG=read.csv("ASQ_pilot_2019_04_09.csv", header = TRUE)
data2=read.csv("ASQ_pilot_2019_04_09.csv", header = TRUE)
#tbl_df(data2)
#View(data2)
```

## SORT DATA BY A VARIABLE
```{R}
#	BOTH COMMANDS SORT THE DATA AND PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT
arrange(data2, Count)
#	arrange(data2, participant_id)
```

## EDIT DATA v1 - not using this code as of April 10, 2019
```{r}
# edit(data2)
# select(data2, everything())
# filter(data2, Count == 12)
filter(data2, participant_id == "IP005")
data3 <- select(data2, participant_id, max.temp)
data3
filter(data3, participant_id  == "IP005")
filter(data3, participant_id  == "IP168")
filter(data3, participant_id  == "IP183")
data3
data3[data3$participant_id == "IP005", "max.temp"] <- 50
data3[data3$participant_id == "IP168", "max.temp"] <- 50
data3[data3$participant_id == "IP183", "max.temp"] <- 48

```

## EDIT DATA v2
```{r}
#	CORRECTING AN ERROR IN THE MAX TEMP OF THREE SUBJECTS
#	CHANGING THE max.temp VALUE
data2[data2$participant_id == "IP005", "max.temp"] <- 50
data2[data2$participant_id == "IP168", "max.temp"] <- 50
data2[data2$participant_id == "IP183", "max.temp"] <- 48

#	CREATING TEMPORARY DATA SUBSET
tmp <- select(data2, participant_id, max.temp)
#	CHECKING THAT THE CHANGE WAS MADE CORRECTLY
filter(tmp, participant_id  == "IP005")
filter(tmp, participant_id  == "IP168")
filter(tmp, participant_id  == "IP183")

#	REMOVING THE TEMPORARY DATA SET
rm(tmp)

#	SAVING THE NEW DATA SET
save(data2, file = "ASQ_pilot.RData")
rm(data2)
#	LOADING THE NEW DATA SET
load(file = "ASQ_pilot.RData")
```


##	ADDING NEW VARIABLES
```{r}
#	CREATE A SMALLER DATA SET
asq_sm <- select(data2,
				 participant_id,
				 starts_with("asq"),
				 starts_with("typical"),
				 max.temp
				 )
# View(asq_sm)

#	COMPUTE ASQ-L VALUES
mutate(asq_sm, asq_l = mean(asq_1a + asq_2a)
	   )
#	ADD THE NEW VARIABLE TO THE SMALLER DATA SET
asq_sm <-  mutate(asq_sm, asq_l = mean(asq_1a + asq_2a)
	   )

```












## SELECTING SUBSETS OF VARIABLES

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
